    "Although I no longer do it professionally, my experience as a chef has has equipped me with a strong work ethic and prepared me for nearly any challenge. It required attention to detail, adaptability, creative problem-solving and innovation all wrapped up with a side of project management, so much fun (not always at the time). Cooking is both a craft and an art (I feel the same about Design) and it allowed me to hone my ability to balance creativity and functionality as chefs don't simply think about the food itself, but how their guests experience it."
